# static array - the size does not change after cration

# dynamic array - size is expandable.  ex. a list
 # 0(1)- fast retreival time since size does not matter , and can be retreived by the loction of the data
 # elements has to shift durring data insertion

# linkedin list - structure and permornace is very diffent , stores pointers to the data instead of the actual data, which can be located anywhere in the memory
 # 0(n) -very slow reterival time since it trevarses through each element in the list
 # elements can be pointed to new node during insertion or deletion, if the location is known
